# Weight-GUI

Please read the Image Source.txt: I did not create the weightlifter.png and inside the text file is a link to the profile of the author (mohamed_hassn) who created it, and a link to the website (pixabay.com) that I downloaded it from. Pixabay allows for free use of their images under their licensing.

This was a fun little GUI that I created that will allow you to input a weight in lbs or kgs and will then calculate how many total plates of the correct size you'll need to put on a weightlifting bar to reach that weight. I got into weightlifting while in college and thought this would be a fun little project to practice using python with.

# Running
To run this you can either run the calculator.py file like you would a regulor python file with the weightlifter.png file included, or you can go into the calculator folder and run the .exe inside.
